# pset 1

## Problem 1

**a)** **A,B,C,D** = <u>(+1,+1,+1), (+1,-1,-1), (-1,+1,-1), (-1,-1,+1)</u>

**b)** **A** ⋅ **B** = A B cos(θ) = -1 ⟹ θ = acos(-1/3) ≈ <u>109°</u>

**c)**
  -  **AB** ⋅ **AC** = 8 cos(θ) = 4 ⟹ θ = acos(1/2) = π/3 = <u>60°</u>
  -  **AB** ⋅ **CD** = 8 cos(θ) = 0 ⟹ θ = acos(0) = π/2 = <u>90°</u>

**d)** (1/2) * 2√2 * 2√2 * sin(π/3) = <u>2√2</u>

## Problem 2

**a)** v₁ ⋅ (v₂-v₃) = 0

**b)**
  -  P lies on the altitude from P₁ ⟺ v₁ ⋅ (v₂-v₃) = 0 ⟺ v₁⋅v₂ - v₁v₃ = 0 ⟺ v₁⋅v₂ = v₁v₃
  -  P lies on the altitude from P₂ ⟺ v₂ ⋅ (v₁-v₃) = 0 ⟺ v₁⋅v₂ - v₂v₃ = 0 ⟺ v₁⋅v₂ = v₂v₃

**c)** v₁v₃ = v₂v₃ ⟺ v₁v₃ - v₂v₃ = 0 ⟺ v₃ ⋅ (v₁-v₂) ⟺ P lies on the altitude from P₃
